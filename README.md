# house-prediction


This is a mini project based on Machine Learning.Here, I got the dataset from Google then viewed its statistics , columns etc to get some information about the data.Visualized the data with matplotlib and seaborn liabraries and estimated the prices of the house .And also checked how well the model worked.
